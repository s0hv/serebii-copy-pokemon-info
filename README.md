# Copy PokÃ©mon info
A userscript to make copying info from serebii.net to https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/index.html easier.
It does it by adding a simple copy button (ðŸ“‹) below each PokÃ©mon which when clicked 
copies it's information in a suitable format to your clipboard. Only works for BDSP battle tower at the moment due to me using more strict url matching.

# Installation

1. Install a userscript manager
    - Only tested on [Violentmonkey]() 
2. Install this userscript: [Copy PokÃ©mon info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s0hv/serebii-copy-pokemon-info/master/copy-pokemon-info.user.js)
3. Go to [Serebii BDSP battle tower](https://www.serebii.net/brilliantdiamondshiningpearl/battletower/) and choose a trainer.
4. ðŸ“‹ icon should be visible under all pokemon in the teams of the selected trainer. Clicking it will copy its information to your clipboard.
